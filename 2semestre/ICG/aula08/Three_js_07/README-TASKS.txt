OLD Folder : example versions using local libraries

NEW Folder : examples without local copies of the libraries, as done during the semester

Check the libs and the assets folders

There are lots of texture images on the texture folders (and sub-folders)

The simple examples in folders 01, 02 and 03 do not require a local server

The examples in folders 04 and 05 do require a local server, since texture files are loaded

Can be easily done using the Visual Studio Code Live Server

The examples in folders 04 and 05 are from J. Dirksen's book


EXTRA TASKS

Correct possible errors / problems in some of the examples

Convert the examples missing in the NEW folder so as to load the libs as JavaScript modules, as we have done during the semester
