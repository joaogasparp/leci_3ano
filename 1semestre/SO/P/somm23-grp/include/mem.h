/**
 * \defgroup mem Memory Management (mem)
 *
 * \details
 *   Initially, the memory is empty, meaning that no process address space is hosted there.
 *   Thus, memory can be seen as a single region with a given dimension.
 *   In order for a process to be executed, one or more blocks of memory must be assigned to it,
 *   in order to host the process' address space segments.
 *   Every segment must be allocated in a continuous block of main memory.
 *
 *   The initial empty region is splitted such that there is a block for
 *   every segment of the process.
 *   To more processes have their address spaces hosted in memory, the empty part is
 *   successively divided.
 *   The way this division is done depends on the allocation policy used.
 *
 *   A running process eventually terminates its execution.
 *   Then, its assigned blocks of memory can be released, becoming available to other processes.
 *   The list of free blocks must be updated to include the released memory.
 *   Every released block may be adjacent to a existent free block or not.
 *   If it is adjacent, a merging must take place.
 *   Otherwise, a new element must be added to the list.
 *
 *   For the first fit approach,
 *   one can see the memory as a set of used blocks plus a set of available
 *   blocks, managing it with two lists:
 *   (a) a list of blocks allocated and assigned to processes;
 *   (b) list of free (not used) blocks.
 *   Both lists must be sorted in ascending order of memory addresses.
 *
 *   For the buddy system approach,
 *   the memory is splitted into halves until a block has enough size to host a segment
 *   but half of it has not.
 *
 *   In order to minimize its external fragmentation, memory is managed in chunks bigger
 *   than a single byte.
 *   This means that the amount of memory assigned to the process is the round up
 *   of the required amount to the chunk size.
 *
 *   The following table presents a list of the functions in this module, including:
 *   - the function name;
 *   - the function ID, that can be used to switch between the binary and group version;
 *   - an estimation of the effort required to implement it;
 *   - a brief description of the function role.
